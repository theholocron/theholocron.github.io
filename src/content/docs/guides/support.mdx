## Need help?

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or need clarification about something:

<Steps>
1. Open a support request ticket from the **Issues** tab on GitHub for the project or reach out via [email](mailto:support@theholocron.dev).
2. Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
3. Provide browser, library and/or platform versions (`nodejs`, `npm`, etc), depending on what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.
</Steps>

### Ask a question

If you chose to ask us a question, then ask a quality question.

**Help us help you!**

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it much easier for us to help.  It’s common to start asking something too specific when you’re close to a problem.  Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

* Try to define what you need help with:
  * Is there something in particular you want to do?
  * What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  * Is there a concept you’re not understanding?
* Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/gg).
* Avoid falling for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378).
* Search on GitHub and Slack to see if a similar question has been asked
* If possible, provide sample code, a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or a video
* The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you

## What's next?

If you chose to write an issue, once it's filed:

* The team will label the issue.
* Someone will try to respond as soon as possible, generally within 5 business days.
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the issue will be closed. If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.
