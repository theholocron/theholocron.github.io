<CoC />

There are many ways to contribute! Most of them don't require any official status unless otherwise noted. That said, there's a couple of positions that grant extra repository abilities, and this section describes how they're granted and what they do.

All of the below positions are granted based on the project team's needs, as well as the consensus opinion about the persons choice to help. The process is relatively informal, and it's likely that people who express interest in participating can be granted the permissions they'd like.

You can spot a collaborator on the repo by looking at [the teams](https://github.com/orgs/theholocron/teams).

### Permissions

Below is a table of various permission levels each member may have and what that may grant them.

Permission | Description
--- | ---
Contributor | Granted to contributors who express a strong interest in spending time on the project's issue tracker. These tasks are mainly [labeling issues](#label-issues), [cleaning up old ones](#clean-up-issues-and-prs), and [reviewing pull requests](#review-pull-requests), as well as all the usual things non-team-member contributors can do. Maintainers should not merge pull requests, tag releases, or directly commit code themselves: that should still be done through the usual pull request process. Becoming a Maintainer means the project team trusts you to understand enough of the team's process and context to implement it on the issue tracker.
Maintainer | Granted to contributors who want to handle the actual pull request merges, tagging new versions, etc. Maintainers should have a good level of familiarity with the codebase, and enough context to understand the implications of various changes, as well as a good sense of the will and expectations of the project team.
[Owner](https://github.com/orgs/theholocron/teams/gatekeepers) | Granted to people ultimately responsible for the project, its community, etc.
