This document describes the governance and decision-making process for the [**@theholocron**](https://github.com/theholocron) organization.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the overall direction, operation, and well-being of the project. They have the authority to merge code, make significant technical decisions, and resolve disputes.

#### Responsibilities:

-   Ensure high-quality contributions.
-   Review and merge pull requests.
-   Define and enforce code standards and project guidelines.
-   Manage releases and versioning.
-   Ensure the project remains active, welcoming, and inclusive.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who participate in the project by submitting code, documentation, or other improvements via pull requests.

#### Responsibilities:

-   Follow project contribution guidelines.
-   Submit pull requests for review.
-   Participate in discussions to help resolve issues and plan features.

### Committers

Committers are contributors with write access to the repository. They can merge their own or others’ changes after peer review, ensuring that they follow the guidelines.

## Decision-Making Process

Decisions are made in a collaborative, consensus-based manner, with input from all maintainers and contributors. We aim for agreement, but in cases of disagreement, the following process applies:

1. **Proposal**: A proposal is created in the form of an issue or pull request. It should clearly outline the problem, solution, and any potential impacts.
2. **Discussion**: Community members and maintainers discuss the proposal in the issue or pull request thread.
3. **Review**: Maintainers and committers review the discussion and offer feedback or approvals.
4. **Decision**:
	- If consensus is reached, the proposal is accepted and merged.
	- If there is no clear consensus, maintainers will make the final decision, considering community input.

## Code of Conduct

All members must adhere to the project’s [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct/). Violations will be handled by maintainers based on the severity and impact.

## Conflict Resolution

In the case of disagreements or disputes, the maintainers will seek to resolve conflicts through consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the maintainers have the final decision-making authority.

## Updates to this Policy

This governance policy is subject to change. Any changes will be made in consultation with the community and must be approved by maintainers.
