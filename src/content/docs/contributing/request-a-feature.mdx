Another way to contribute is to help improve the library by suggesting new ideas within the system. While we may not accept every feature, it doesn't hurt to suggest improvements, but please stop and think about the intent of the project.  Maybe its better in another independent project, or maybe not; there is no harm in asking, or filling out a feature request.  Before you do submit, please look at the road map (typically stored at `./ROADMAP.md` on the repository) to see if I've already thought of your feature.  And remember, if I don't like the idea, doesn't mean you can't fork the project.

## Filling Out a Feature Request

Now its time to submit a ticket. Feature requests should be thorough and not leave anyone wondering or questioning what you were thinking. No one should have to ask you anything or require further clarification. When creating a ticket, use the **Feature Request template** on GitHub to populate a lot of the information required. Below is a brief description of the parts of a feature request:

* **Is your feature request related to a problem?**: A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]
* **Describe the solution you'd like**: A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.Â  Acceptance criteria are important for us to ensure a proper and complete feature.
* **Describe alternatives you've considered**: A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
* **Additional context**: Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

### Example Feature Request

Follow the example below and you'll be on the right path.

```markdown
Title: Progress bar component

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Not related to a problem. I would like to see an indicator of impressions to ad requests
so that I can visualize the loss.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I think a progress bar where the total value shown is the full width of
the contained area, and the part that is filled in is the impressions.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A funnel chart was considered but its too similar to Googles design and
Legal fears repercussions.

**Additional context**
N/A
```
