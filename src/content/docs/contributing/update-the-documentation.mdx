Documentation is a super important, critical part of this project. Docs are how we keep track of the what, how, and why of we're doing; it's how we stay on the same page about our policies. And it's how we tell others everything they need in order to be able to use this project -- or contribute to it. So thank you in advance.

Contributions of any size are welcome! Feel free to file a PR even if you're rewording a sentence to be more clear, or fixing a spelling mistake!

## Contribute

<Steps>
1. [Set up the project](./).
2. Edit or add any relevant documentation.
3. Make sure your changes are formatted correctly and consistently with the rest of the documentation.
4. Re-read what you wrote, and run a spellchecker on it to make sure you didn't miss anything. Check out [Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com) for spelling and grammar mistakes as well as tone of writing.
5. In your commit message(s), begin the first line with `chore(docs): `. For example: `chore(docs): Adding a doc contrib section to CONTRIBUTING.md`.
6. Write clear, concise commit message(s) using the [convention](../reference/commit-convention). Documentation commits should use `chore(docs): <message>`.
7. Go to the **Pulls** tab in GitHub and open a new pull request with your changes and fill out the template with the appropriate information.
8. If your PR is connected to an open issue, add a line in your PR's description that says `Fixes: #123`, where `#123` is the number of the issue you're fixing.
</Steps>

## What's Next?

* One or more maintainers will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
* If the maintainer asks for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for another review.
* If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's ok! We still really appreciate you taking the time to do it, and we don't take that lightly.
* If your PR gets accepted, it will be marked as such with the `next-release` label, and merged soon after. Your contribution will be distributed to the masses next time the maintainers [tag a release](../maintaining/releases)
